//its a tree
//can be binary heap
//designed to get the highest priority element at any point in time

//min heap: the parent node is always less than the child nodes
//max heap: the parent node is always greater than or equal to the child nodes

//heaps are used to get the min value or max value present in a heap in 0(1) time
//while non linear data structures can get you this value in 0(log n) time

//heap time complexities
//  -accessing the min or max value - 0(1)
//  -inserting an element 0(log n)
//  -removing an element 0(log n)
