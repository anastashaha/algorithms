//BFS & Queue:

//DFS:

//Divide and conquer:

//Backtracking algorithm:
//find all possible routes that go from first node to end node

//Dynamic Programming algorithm
// As a reminder, with DP, we break the original problem down to several sub-problems recursively until the sub-problems are small enough to be solved directly. Then we combine the results of sub-problems to obtain the final solution for the original problem.
